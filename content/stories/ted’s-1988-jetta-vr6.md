Back in high school all my friends had MK1s & 2s. I’d left the VW bug for years until mid college, when I stumbled upon an ’86 Jetta GL in Alpine White. I converted it to big bumpers but it was killed by a Jeep Cherokee, when the driver came across the line and hit me head on.

I then found a 91… in white. Had that done up with smoked areos, VR6 lip and all the Votex trimmings, until that was also killed on 9/11.

Later that year at H2O, a friend saw me there and told me he had a car for me… a white Jetta! And here we are today.

#### Tell us about what you did on the outside!

It’s an 88 sprayed 91 Alpine white, and I wanted to do something different. I had the Vortex approved look, but wanted to do it another way.

Went with euro bumpers painted MK1 Campaign style (also Jetta Court as I found out just recently), euro fenders, skinny moulding with fat half spats, 16v Chin, 90 spec euro plate tub, Rallye grill with lower section extended to meet the fenders to fill the gap that leaves the in front end, and I had to search for the GTX side badges to match the rear. In the back there’s also the GLI hard spoiler.

I’ve also smoothed the engine bay bay and the radiator support.

#### Great choice going with those Borbet. Can you give us some details about them?
I saw the wheels on Volksforum.nl back in 01 and knew I had to have them. I reached out to a friend, Shahid Malik of Styledynamix in London, and told him I didn’t care about anything, but I needed them.
