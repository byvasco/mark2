My name is Brendan, I’m from Simi Valley CA, and I own a 1989 Volkswagen Golf.

I used to ride by this car on my bike every day when I was 15 years old. It never moved. The last time it had been registered was 1999. I would knock on the door every few months, trying to convince the owner to sell it to me.

By the time I was 18, he finally agreed. I had it towed home that night.
